# Heated Rye-valry - Game Pitch

**A cozy dating sim meets bakery service game.** You work at a bakery with one coworker, serving a steady stream of customers demanding pastries. While you juggle grabbing items from the display case or rushing to baking stations to whip up fresh goods, your coworker keeps chatting you up. Every response affects their affinity for you—let it drop too low and they'll quit, replaced by a new face the next day. Can you keep the customers happy, the shelves stocked, *and* win your coworker's heart?
